\noindent {\bf Overview:} 
Nearby galaxies are critical for understanding galaxy evolution. Only there can observations directly resolve the vicinity of active nuclei, individual star-forming clouds and star clusters, while still covering the full galactic disk. This comprehensive view lets us connect the small-scale physics of the interstellar medium (ISM) and star formation (SF) to the disk-wide processes that drive galaxy evolution. 

JWST's angular resolution, sensitivity and coverage of the diagnostic-rich near- to mid-IR will revolutionize this field.  Wide-field imaging will be necessary to cover large portions of a galaxyâ€™s disk, given the small footprint of the spectroscopic instruments.  Luckily the NIRCAM and MIRI imagers are equipped with an array of photometric filters that cover individual emission lines, dust emission features, ice/dust absorption, and broadband continuum.  Imaging through these filters will allow the community to address important questions related to the ISM, SF, and AGN in nearby galaxies.  To properly interpret these photometric observations, it is critical to anchor them to spectroscopy.  Linked spectroscopy and photometry is a unique feature of our proposal, one that will allow us to perfect  and share techniques to create high fidelity photometric maps of emission lines and other features using combinations of the narrow, medium and wide-bands.  An early investment in linking spectroscopy and photometry will benefit the entire nearby and high redshift galaxy community.

We propose a photometric and spectroscopic treasury survey towards one archetypal system, M51, to kick start the era of JWST science in nearby galaxies.  This survey will simultaneously let us address fundamental questions about SF, feedback, dust and gas in galaxies while also becoming the backbone for many future SF/ISM studies using the NIRCAM and MIRI filter set. We propose to image the galaxy in {\bf all} of the filters covering key ISM features---by doing these observations together in one project we will make the most efficient use of JWST's time, since nearby galaxy observations such as these are dominated by overheads rather than integration time.  Our Treasury dataset will be immediately usable for many science goals, and we will create tools for the community to optimize the use of JWST's imaging capabilities.    

M51 is the natural choice for a representative nearby galaxy. Because of its environmental richness, it has been extensively observed by facilities from X-ray through radio wavelengths. M51 hosts a Seyfert~2 AGN \citep{ho1997} which shows evidence for a jet interacting with the surrounding ISM \citep{querejeta2016} and a strong two-arm spiral  featuring deep dust lanes and feathers extending into the interarm regions \citep{lavigne2006}. At M51's distance of 8.6~Mpc \citep{mcquinn2016}, JWST's resolution samples the 3--30~pc scales of individual stellar clusters, star-forming regions, and molecular clouds.  Our program will leverage new JWST data with M51's broad ancillary database to specifically address critical questions on the cycle of dust, gas, SF and feedback in galaxies:

{\em Over its lifetime, JWST will conduct the types of observations we propose for M51 many times over for nearby galaxies.}  While observing nearby galaxies may seem straightforward, their large angular extent, high dynamic range in surface brightness, and widespread extended emission present unique challenges. We have designed an efficient observing program that will allow the community to prototype critical science investigations on nearby galaxies.  It involves imaging the main star-forming body of M51 in all ISM/SF diagnostic photometric bands with NIRCam and MIRI, accompanied by targeted spectroscopy of the nucleus and a spiral arm with the NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs.  Just as importantly, {\em we propose to produce a Nearby Galaxy Toolkit} crucial for galaxy research and beyond. Table~\ref{tab:overview} provides an overview of our proposed observations, science goals and our products for the community.

\noindent {\bf Science Goal 1.~The Life-Cycle of Star-Forming Regions:} Stars and clusters form out of molecular gas and then exert strong feedback on their parent clouds. A major goal of current ISM and SF studies is to understand how this violent life cycle produces the observed large scale relationship between gas and star formation \citep[e.g.,][]{kennicutt2012}. This can best be achieved via high resolution observations of nearby galaxies that resolve tracers of feedback, the ISM, and SF cloud-by-cloud over a large, well-characterized environment.

JWST is ideal for such studies. Pairing high resolution with IR diagnostics will allow us to measure the physical state of the gas, trace otherwise invisible SF, and identify feedback signatures cloud-by-cloud. Our observations of M51 will yield galaxy-wide maps of hot dust, ionized gas, radiative-phase supernova (SN) remnants and shocks via [Fe{\small II}] \citep{alonso-herrero2003} and vibrationally-excited H$_2$. We will compare these signatures of feedback and SF to the properties of the 1,500 molecular clouds already known and characterized in the inner 9$\times$7~kpc$^{2}$ of M51 \citep{colombo2014}. We will assign each individual cloud an evolutionary state (star-forming, quiescent, being destroyed), which is impossible to do at {\em Spitzer}'s resolution outside the Local Group. From the population statistics, we will model the life cycle and destruction mechanism for molecular clouds \citep[e.g.,][]{corbelli2017}.

High resolution JWST observations of the 3--5\micron\ hot dust continuum and Br$\alpha$ will also reveal new heavily embedded young clusters and yield accurate dust extinctions (and thus better ages and masses) for already-known young clusters. Only the brightest deeply embedded clusters were found by {\em Spitzer} \citep[][]{elmegreen2014}. With much deeper observations and $>$10$\times$ better angular resolution ($<$0\farcs2), we will detect embedded clusters with masses as low as 3$\times$10$^3$ M$_{\odot}$, giving us a much more complete snapshot of this early, hidden phase of star formation. The abundance of young clusters in the arm vs.\ interarm regions will indicate the relative importance of two main star/cloud formation drivers---spiral shocks and self-gravitational clumping in the arms \citep{kim2002}---and measure the persistence of star formation downstream from the spiral arm \citep{koda2009}. 

\vspace{0.05in}

\noindent \underline{Additional Science Goals \& Prototypes:}

    \begin{parhang}
    \noindent
    $\bullet$~{\bf Improve SFR Tracers:} Combining JWST Br$\alpha$ with existing HST H$\alpha$, Pa$\alpha$, and Pa$\beta$, we will measure extinction towards H{\small II} regions, test empirical extinction estimators and proposed IR cirrus corrections, and calibrate alternative SFR indicators (e.g.\ 11.3\micron\ PAH).% \vspace{-0.1in}
    \end{parhang}
    \begin{parhang}
    \noindent
    $\bullet$~{\bf Tracing CO-Dark Gas with H$_{2}$:} We will combine the H$_2$ rotational and vibrational emission spectrum observed by JWST with existing CO, [C{\small II}] and dust maps to probe the mass and state of the CO-dark H$_2$ gas component \citep[e.g.,][]{togi2016}.
    \end{parhang}
        
    \begin{parhang}
    \noindent
    $\bullet$~{\bf Metallicity Diagnostics:} We will quantify extinction- and temperature-insensitive metallicity diagnostics, using optical-mid-IR spectral coverage provided by LBT-MODS \citep{croxall2015}, NIRSpec, and MIRI towards the H{\small II} region in the spiral arm spectral strip. JWST's resolution will allow matched aperture extraction of the optical through mid-IR neon and sulfur lines and mid-IR H recombination lines. With matched Br$\alpha$, [Ne{\small II}]12.81\micron, and [Ne{\small III}]15.56\micron, H{\small II} region metallicities will be accurately determined.
    % LKH edit for brevity overcoming the major issues with previous studies of mid-IR metallicity diagnostics. %\vspace{-0.1in} Detection of [NeII]12.8um and [NeIII]15.6um, together with Br alpha, will provide an accurate determination of HII region metallicities, insensitive to temperature uncertainties and almost independent of extinction.
    \end{parhang}

    \begin{parhang}
    \noindent
    $\bullet$~{\bf Wolf Rayet Signatures:} We will identify WR stars (3--5~Myr; $>$25$M_\odot$), if present, with NIRSpec spectra  covering multiple C{\small IV}, He{\small I} and He{\small II} emission lines \citep{pasquali2002,kanarek2017}. We will use them to independently determine cluster ages and study their role in driving feedback \citep[e.g.,][]{sokal2016}. 
    \end{parhang}

\vspace{0.2\baselineskip}
\noindent {\bf Science Goal 2.\ Dust Production:} Stellar evolution models of cool evolved stars, including intermediate-mass AGB stars and massive red supergiants (RSGs), remain highly uncertain due to complex mixing, dredge up, and mass loss processes. Their short lifetimes also make them rare, resulting in few statistically robust samples, especially in the IR where their spectral energy distributions peak. Together with SN ejecta and grain growth in the interstellar medium, both AGB and RSG stars contribute to the dust budget \citep{matsuura2009,boyer2012,srinivasan2016}. Because of distance uncertainties in the Milky Way,  extragalactic surveys are critical for constraining models and understanding dust production from evolved stars in metal-rich environments. 

JWST's angular resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage will revolutionize our understanding of dust-producing evolved stars in nearby galaxies. Optical HST data from \citet{mcquinn2016} demonstrate that AGB and RSG stars are easily identified in the disk of M51, despite issues of crowding and confusion. In the near-IR, these stars are even brighter, ensuring detection with JWST. NIRCam imaging in F162M, F182M, F360M, and F460M will sample the SED and key molecular features  (H$_2$O, CN, C$_2$, SiO, and HCN) essential for estimating the stellar mass and the strength of mixing processes in the atmosphere. This filter set also efficiently separates C-rich and O-rich AGB stars (see Figure~1). MIRI imaging will sample the circumstellar dust, revealing the dust mineralogy and production efficiency (F1000W, F1130W, and F1800W sample silicate features in O-rich AGB stars and F560M, F1500W, and F2100W sample the dust continuum). Together the NIRCam and MIRI observations will constrain the composition and dust production rate of all of M51's evolved stars.

\vspace{0.2\baselineskip}
\noindent {\bf Science Goal 3.~The Evolution of PAHs:} Mid-IR emission from small dust grains provides a critical glimpse into the composition and properties of interstellar dust. Single photons can heat small grains to non-equilibrium temperatures, exciting internal vibrational modes that reveal their structure and composition. The mid-IR bands of PAHs are one of the most easily observable of these features. Roughly 5\% of all the non-primordial radiative energy emitted over the full history of the Universe has been channeled through PAHs, emerging either as mid-IR emission or photoelectrons \citep{dole2006,smith2007}. The PAH spectrum and photoelectric heating efficiency depend on the abundance, size, and charge of the PAHs---properties that have all been suggested to vary within galaxies \citep{bakes1994,weingartner2001,croxall2012}. JWST will dramatically advance characterization of PAHs with its high angular resolution and ability to cover the critical PAH 3.3\micron\ feature. This feature is dominated by the smallest, neutral PAHs that can survive in the ISM. Most longer wavelength PAH bands are formed from combinations of neutral and ionized PAHs across a range of sizes, and so have more limited diagnostic potential. However, the 11.3\micron\ feature is dominated by large neutral PAHs \citep{bauschlicher2008}; thus the ratio of the 3.3/11.3\micron\ features, both of which JWST can efficiently observe, provides the most unambiguous size diagnostic of the PAH population.

We will use the 3.3\micron\ spectral region, made newly accessible via JWST imaging and spectroscopy, to study the evolution of PAHs in M51. The NIRCam F335M and MIRI F1130W will let us create high resolution maps of the 3.3/11.3\micron\ ratio, revealing the PAH size distribution across the galaxy. With NIRSpec spectroscopy, the 3.3\micron\ region will reveal new diagnostics of PAH chemical structure: the 3.4\micron\ aliphatic feature traces linear carbon-chain vibrational modes that are highly diagnostic of the structural state of the smallest grains \citep{joblin1996}.  We will study variations of the 3.3/3.4\micron\ features across a spiral arm using the relative aliphatic content to infer grain growth and chemical alteration of PAHs in dense regions \citep[e.g.,][]{berne2009} as well as production of PAHs via shattering \citep{yamagishi2012}.  Previous facilities did not have the combined spectral coverage, sensitivity, and angular resolution required to investigate these PAH diagnostics in galaxies.

    \begin{parhang}
    \noindent
     \end{parhang}
     \begin{parhang}
     \noindent
    $\bullet$~{\bf Extragalactic C$_{60}$:} Buckminsterfullerene has been observed in a number of MW reflection and planetary nebulae, but has not yet been detected outside the Local Group.  JWST's sensitivity and the ability to isolate intense PDRs and stellar remnants at high angular resolution will give us the first opportunity to place strong limits on C$_{60}$ in M51.
    \end{parhang}
    \begin{parhang}
    \noindent
    $\bullet$~{\bf H$_2$ Shock Heating:} Rotational H$_2$ lines are one of the major coolants of warm molecular gas above 100~K. 
    Their strength relative to PAH emission is now regularly used as a signpost of shocks. 
    We will use the rotational excitation and PAH emission from MIRI spectroscopy to quantify densities and temperatures, diagnose shocks, and trace departures from ortho-para equilibrium tied to thermalization timescales of shocked gas. Such departures were found in some {\em Spitzer}/IRS pointings within M51 and other galaxies  \citep{roussel2007}, but  the coarse angular resolution and low sensitivity of those observations prevented the thorough analysis that will now be possible with MIRI.
    \end{parhang}
    %\vspace{-0.1in}
%\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.05in}

\noindent {\bf Science Goal~4. Resolving the AGN's Zone of Influence:} 
JWST observations will provide an unprecedented view of the interaction of AGN with their surrounding ISM by spatially resolving key mid-IR observables. Intense AGN radiation heats nearby dust up to sublimation temperatures, with the bulk of its emission emerging in the $\sim$3--20\micron\ range. This process potentially alters the dust size distribution from a standard ISM distribution to favor predominantly large grains  \citep[e.g.,][]{kishimoto2007,honig2017}. However, the role of the AGN in exciting and/or destroying the PAHs is still uncertain within $\sim100$~pc \citep{smith2007,jensen2017}.

The hard AGN radiation and the shocks created by outflows and jets are able to ionize and excite the ISM to levels far above that possible in H{\small II} regions.  JWST offers access to near- and mid-IR line diagnostics that can clearly trace the impact of the AGN  and shocks, and separate them from the effects of young stars  \citep{dale2004,dale2009,scharwachter2013,colina2015,smajic2015}. Nuclear pointings of the NIRSpec IFU will detect coronal lines such as [Si{\small VI}]1.963\micron\ and [Si{\small VII}]2.483\micron\ that probe the AGN ionizing spectrum, and lines such as [Fe{\small II}]1.644\micron\ that are known tracers of shocks.  Nuclear pointings of the MIRI IFU will access mid-IR AGN diagnostics, such as those based on the [Ne{\small V}]/[Ne{\small II}] ratio and PAH equivalent widths. Quantifying the AGN emission will lead to a robust determination of the local SFR to assess whether SF is locally suppressed or enhanced by AGN-related shocks  \citep{silk2013}. The spectroscopic observations with R$\sim$1000--3000 will resolve $v \sim$100~km/s and reveal the structure of molecular gas (H$_2$) and dust in the nuclear environment, as well as kinematically reconstruct the resolved outflow and allow us to directly connect the ionization and heating of the gas with the dynamics of the ISM.

In M51, observations from the JVLA (synchrotron), PdBI (CO), and HST (H$\alpha$ and [O{\small III}]5007) indicate the orientation of the AGN jet and the location of possible AGN impacted gas for purposes of orienting our spectral ``strip'' observations \citep{querejeta2016}.  


%\vspace{0.1in}
\medskip
\noindent {\bf A Community Science Toolkit:} Beyond the JWST observations, our team will develop a suite of tools and documentation for the community that address key aspects in planning and executing observations of nearby galaxies. These include:

\vspace{0.05in}

%\noindent {\bf (\#1) Near- to Mid-IR Spectral Templates:} JWST will enable near- through mid-IR spectral mapping with the resolution to separate molecular clouds and PDRs from H{\small II} regions and diffuse interarm material.  Spectroscopy from the ground has covered parts of the near-IR spectrum but over limited areas.  {\em Spitzer} performed extensive spectral mapping in the mid-IR but at $\sim$100~pc resolution. JWST's angular and spectral resolution plus wavelength coverage is such a dramatic leap beyond previous facilities that predicting necessary exposures, appropriate filter combinations, grism choices and more are challenging tasks for proposers. In the current JWST ETC, template options are limited to low spectral resolution galaxy-integrated measurements from  \citet{brown2014}. For that reason, one of our initial Science Enabling Products will be the delivery of near- through mid-IR spectral templates derived from our NIRSpec and MIRI IFU observations (which each cover $\sim$500$\times$125~pc over multiple environments).  We will create templates for resolved molecular regions/PDRs, H{\small II} regions, diffuse interarm emission (with stacking if needed), and the central AGN and jet.  We will work with STScI to incorporate these into the ETC for 
%Cycle~2 proposers to use for observation planning. Later deliveries will include tools so observers can generate their own custom templates from the full coverage, resolution-matched, spectrally-stitched cubes. 

\vspace{0.05in}

\noindent {\bf (\#1) Photometric ISM/SF Diagnostic Tools:} Because of the small field of view of JWST's spectroscopic instruments, narrow and medium band imaging that isolates spectral lines and dust features will be a critical mode of JWST observing in nearby galaxies, where both high spatial resolution and wide area mapping are needed. For continuum removal and estimating exposure times, proposers need information on various medium band options and scaling factors. We will provide the community with documentation, code and examples of continuum removal using our NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI spectroscopy and imaging. We will generate spectral templates for resolved molecular regions/PDRs, H{\small II} regions, diffuse interarm emission (with stacking if needed), and the central AGN and jet. These can then be used to predict scaling factors for combinations of narrow and medium bands for NIRCam as well as medium band combinations in MIRI to isolate PAH features.  Those predictions will be tested on our NIRCam and MIRI images by comparing directly with the known line intensities from spectral mapping.  We will assess the quality of continuum removal across the galaxy and provide tutorials for applying it to future observations. We will also investigate optimizing combinations of multiple medium bands as well as spatially dependent recipes that vary across the galaxy.

\vspace{0.05in} 

\noindent {\bf (\#2) Convolution Kernels and Routines:}  Over the wide wavelength coverage of JWST, the PSF width will vary by more than an order of magnitude and change shape from instrument to instrument. This makes PSF matching critical for comparing resolved emission across different instruments and spectral regimes. To enable this key step, we will generate a library of convolution kernels that match JWST observations across wavelength and instrument, including for IFU spectral maps.  Members of our team generated kernels that have been widely used to analyze {\em Spitzer} and {\em Herschel} observations \citep{gordon2008,sandstrom2009,aniano2011}. We will also provide kernels that match JWST observations to PSFs from other facilities (e.g., {\em Spitzer}).  We will also provide open-source Python code to perform convolutions using the kernels.

\vspace{0.05in} 

%\noindent {\bf (\#4) Point Source Photometry Catalogs \& Documentation:} JWST's sensitivity and angular resolution make luminous stars, particularly the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and red giant/supergiant stars, observable in galaxies out to $\sim$10~Mpc, even in crowded disks like that of M51.  Resolved stars will also be frequently observed in parallel observations, typically sampling galaxy halos. Detecting resolved stars in nearby galaxies, even serendipitously, will thus be a routine occurrence for JWST observers.  To prepare the community for  such observations, we will create software tools and demonstrate photometry in both M51's disk using our NIRCam and MIRI imaging, and in the sparse outer halo as observed in parallel with NIRISS.
%NIRISS/NIRCam.  Documentation and tutorials will be provided to the community, in addition to the results of artificial star tests to characterize the photometric uncertainty and completeness limits of the catalogs.

%\vspace{0.05in} 

\noindent {\bf (\#3) IFU Calibration Tests in Bright Nearby Galaxies:} Bright, extended nearby galaxies pose some challenges for IFU observations with JWST. For NIRSpec, leakage through faulty MSA slits will contaminate the observations.  When those slits sit on top of a bright galaxy, contamination will be a major concern.  The conservative approach is to obtain ``leakcal'' observations with the same configuration for each observation, doubling the needed time investment.  For MIRI, extended sources make it impossible to use nodding to remove the sky and telescope thermal backgrounds and spectral fringing.  Therefore, an ``off'' position will be required, at large angular separation. %The performance of ``off'' observations is not well known as a function of time difference from when the target observations are taken.  
We will obtain a conservative set of calibrations for our IFU spectroscopy including NIRSpec ``leakcals'' at every position, dither, and grating setting and MIRI ``offs'' both before and after our science observations. We will assess the performance of the complete calibration set, and the consequences of omitting different aspects (e.g., obtaining a MIRI ``off'' 10 hours after the target or one ``leakcal'' per mosaic position) by dropping parts of the calibration set in the processing. This information will aid community planning for efficient JWST IFU observations in bright, extended objects.

\vspace{0.05in} 

\noindent {\bf (\#4) Updating PAHFIT for JWST Extragalactic Science:}  Galaxy mid-infrared spectra are rich with diagnostics of molecular and ionized gas and dust grains, all set against a variable blend of starlight, hot grain emission, and other continuum sources, attenuated by opacity from ices and silicates.  Disentangling this complicated spectral region requires physically motivated and empirically validated modeling.  PAHFIT, developed for {\em Spitzer}/IRS spectroscopy, is the preeminent tool for the decomposition of mid-IR spectra of galaxies and other sources \citep{smith2007}.  Updating PAHFIT for the JWST era will be critical to fully exploit the diagnostic potential offered by the combined NIRSpec/MIRI IFUs.  We will adapt PAHFIT to {\em i}) treat the high and variable spectral resolution, including newly resolved PAH sub-features, {\em ii}) extend wavelength coverage down to 2\micron\ with preliminary pre-launch input from an ongoing {\em Akari}--{\em Spitzer} cross-archival study, and {\em iii}) introduce updated extinction models for both ices and silicates.  M51 spectroscopy will be a crucial first step in bringing the power of spectral decomposition to the JWST extragalactic community.

%\noindent {\bf The M51 Treasury Team:} We have assembled an international team of 54 researchers whose expertise spans the breadth of science that JWST will do in nearby galaxies: from studying the $\sim$pc vicinity of AGN to the substructure in the stellar halo. The process of bringing together such diverse expertise has let us create an observing program that efficiently captures a dataset useful for almost any nearby galaxy researcher. Our team is well prepared to create and deliver the Science Enabling Products described above, as demonstrated by our roles in generating such products for previous missions \citep{dale2006,smith2007,gordon2008,aniano2011,boyer2013}.  We will rapidly share our knowledge with the community through science and observation planning telecons and a dedicated website where we will post updates and host a repository of M51's ancillary observations, many of which were collected by our team members.

We propose imaging and spectroscopy of M51 using NIRCam, NIRSpec and MIRI. M51 contains extended emission in all of our tracers. To calculate exposure times, except where specifically noted, we use predictions of the surface brightness in each tracer and aim to detect that level at $>$3$\sigma$ significance in an $r$=0\farcs2 region. The reference surface brightnesses are measured with instruments with resolution $\geq$1\arcsec, often $\gg$1\arcsec, and the proposed JWST observations will highly resolve the emitting structures, providing higher S/N than stated. Background levels appropriate for the vicinity of M51 in April 2019 are used in the ETC.

\noindent {\bf NIRCam Mosaic:} We will obtain NIRCam imaging in SW and LW modules covering the star-forming disk of M51 in 10 filters: 5 centered on emission lines or dust features (F164N: [Fe{\small II}]1.64\micron, F187N: Pa$\alpha$, F212N: H$_2$ 2.12\micron, F335M: PAH 3.3\micron, F405N: Br$\alpha$) and 5 centered on nearby continuum regions (F162M, F182M, F360M, F430M, F460M). The lines provide diagnostics of gas, dust, star formation, and feedback (Science Goals 1, 2).  The medium bands enable continuum removal as well as diagnostics of the AGB star population (Science Goal 3).  

To cover the main disk of M51, we construct a 2$\times$2 mosaic ($\sim$30~arcmin$^2$). To minimize overheads, we use 3 intramodule primary and 2 subpixel dithers for each position rather than the 3TIGHT pattern. Our observations will be deep enough that uniform coverage and the 3TIGHT associated overheads are unnecessary.  
% LKH edit We will create 
Separate mosaics for each SW/LW pair will minimize filter changes. All position angles (PA) will result in adequate coverage, but we request the same PA for all mosaics to ensure matched coverage. We will use NIRISS in parallel, and note that at PA$\sim$140$\deg$ we would also cover M51b (NGC~5195).

\vspace{0.05in}

\noindent \underline{Exposure Times:} We calculate the exposure needed to detect the integrated intensity of each line in the relevant filter. Continuum removal will use a scaled nearby medium band. To minimize noise introduced by continuum removal, we need high relative S/N in the medium band; this process will then be dominated by systematic effects from sampling different wavelengths, which we will explore in Science Enabling Product {\bf (\#2)}. 
For all calculations we use 6 exposures (set by the dithers) with the BRIGHT1 read-out, 
% LKH edit which will provide robust ramp fits over our relatively short observations. We adjust 
and the groups/int are adjusted to reach our desired S/N. Tables~\ref{tab:narrow} and \ref{tab:medium} show the relevant ETC calculations.

Br$\alpha$ limits reflect minimum surface brightness on outskirts of SF regions. We neglect H$\alpha$ extinction corrections to obtain conservative estimates.

Notes: Exposure times in the medium band filters are set to obtain high S/N for the continuum and AGB/RGB stars.  Based on the LMC, we expect the $K$-band tip of the RGB (tRGB) to be $K$=23.2 mag.  Almost every thermally-pulsing AGB star will be brighter than this limit (fainter AGB stars are dusty and will be detected at longer wavelengths).  We use an M0III star with $K$=23.5 mag as our target. *For dusty AGB stars, the F430M band will have much higher S/N ($\sim100$).

\vspace{0.25in}
\noindent {\bf MIRI Mosaic:}  We will observe the central disk of M51 in 7 MIRI filters sampling the continuum and PAH features.  F1000W and F1130W observations will be used to create a map of the 11.3\micron\ PAH feature (using F1000W for continuum) at $\sim$10~pc resolution (Science Goal 2).  Likewise, F770W and F1800W respectively trace the 7.7\micron\ and 17\micron\ PAH complexes (using F560W and F1500W for the nearby continua).  The F2100W filter traces embedded star formation (Science Goal 1). All filters will be critical for studying AGB dust production (Science Goal 3).

We will observe a 2$\times$4 MIRI mosaic ($\sim$20~arcmin$^2$) using a 4-point dither pattern optimized for point sources 
%(optimal for AGB stars and parallel NIRCam, with no detriment to extended sources). 
(optimal for AGB stars, with no detriment to extended sources). 
For all PAs, the MIRI mosaic lies mostly inside the NIRCam mosaic, so we do not require PA constraints. We will obtain one ``off'' galaxy field for background subtraction. 
%We will use NIRCam in parallel (module B only).

\vspace{0.05in}

\noindent \underline{Exposure Times:} We use {\em Spitzer} IRS observations to predict the surface brightness in the MIRI filters. At 10\micron, faint interarm regions are $\sim$1~MJy/sr, while at 11.3 and 21.0\micron\ these regions are $\sim$2$\times$ brighter.  We use at least 4 exposures (set by the dithers) in the FAST read-out mode with 22 groups/int. To avoid potential saturation from bright backgrounds, for F2100W we divide the observation into 3 integrations. We obtain S/N=10, 8 and 3 for F1000W (244s), F1130W (244s) and F2100W (732s), S/N$\sim$40, 16 and 5 for a representative dusty AGB star.  Saturation is avoided with this strategy, even up to $\sim$10$^3$~MJy/sr.

\vspace{0.1in}

\noindent {\bf NIRSpec IFU:} To study the effect of the AGN on its surroundings (Science Goal 4) and the variation of the 3.3/3.4\micron\ PAH features (Science Goal 3), we propose two 4$\times$1 NIRSpec IFU mosaics. One will be oriented to cover the AGN and its jet (``nuclear strip'') the other to transect a spiral arm, covering dense gas, embedded star formation and an H{\small II} region (``arm strip''). The nuclear strip orientation is fixed by the jet to PA=330--340$\deg$, which is visible for $\sim$20 days each year. The mosaic can be adjusted with column/row shifts for other PAs if needed to increase scheduling flexibility. We use the same PA for the 1$\times$4 arm strip mosaic to cut across the arm---this PA can also be adjusted.

For the arm, our science goals require observing the 3.3/3.4\micron\ PAH features and bright emission lines (H recombination, H$_2$ 2.12\micron). These features can be efficiently observed using the prism grating (0.7--5.3\micron).  For the nuclear strip, we target diagnostics of the highly ionized gas in the vicinity of the AGN as well as kinematic signatures of outflows and shocks on order of $\sim$100~km/s which will require R$\sim$1000. We therefore use the medium resolution gratings (G140M, G235M, G395M; 0.97--5.27\micron). We will use a ``small'' 4 dither cycling pattern.  We do not need nods or ``off'' calibrations for the NIRSpec dataset because of very low background, but leakage through the MSA slits will be an issue for M51. We will obtain ``leakcals'' for every position, dither, and grating setting. 

\vspace{0.05in}

\noindent \underline{Exposure Times:} We use the NRSRAPID read out with 4 exposures set by the dither pattern.

\noindent $\bullet$ {\bf Arm Strip (Prism):} Key tracers in the arm strip are stellar continuum, 3.3/3.4\micron\ PAH, H$_2$ 2.12\micron, and Br$\alpha$.  The most stringent S/N limit is set by detecting an H$_2$ 2.12\micron\ at 6$\times$10$^{-6}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/sr appropriate for massive star-forming regions \citep{yeh2015}. For 901s integration (20 groups) we obtain S/N=$2.4$. All other observables will be securely detected: S/N$\sim$5--40 (continuum), $>$40 (PAH 3.3\micron), $>$15 (PAH 3.4\micron), $\sim$5 (Br$\alpha$).

\noindent $\bullet$ {\bf Nuclear Strip (G140M/G235M/G395M):} For the nuclear strip our key observables are [Fe{\small II}]1.64\micron, the 3.3/3.4\micron\ PAHs, H recombination lines, and highly ionized gas in the vicinity of the AGN.  The high ionization lines have a range of intensities, but many (e.g.\ [Fe{\small II}]1.64\micron, [Si{\small VI}]1.96\micron) are at least as strong as Br$\alpha$ in MAPPINGS photoionization models \citep{groves2006}. We thus target the average Br$\alpha$ intensity in the nuclear strip of 1.9$\times$10$^{-5}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/sr.  With 472s exposures we achieve S/N$\sim$7; the same exposure time is used for each grating setting. The nuclear region in particular will be resolved into compact, bright features, so we expect strong detections of the lines.

\vspace{0.1in}

\noindent {\bf MIRI IFU:} We target the arm and nuclear strips with the MIRI IFU.  These observations cover key diagnostic lines (H$_2$ rotational lines, [Ne{\small II}], [Ne{\small III}]) and dust (5--18\micron\ PAH). The PAH spectrum is critical to Science Goal~3. Ionized gas and shock diagnostics in the nucleus will reveal feedback mechanisms (Science Goal~4). 

We match NIRSpec's coverage with a 4-pointing mosaic and PA=150--160$\deg$. This provides $\sim$20 days of visibility, and the PA can be adjusted if necessary.  We will observe in all channels and grating settings, with simultaneous imaging in F2550W \citep[to study hot dust in star-forming regions:][]{calzetti2005,dale2017}. The simultaneous MIRI imaging observations increase the total charged time by only 4.4\%. We employ a 4-point dither optimized for extended sources and utilize the FAST readout. We will obtain off-galaxy observations before and after the science targets to remove the background/telescope thermal emission.  These will also mitigate fringing in the MRS spectra.  We have sequenced the MIRI IFU observations to ensure ``offs'' are taken before and after the primary science targets.

\vspace{0.05in}

\noindent \underline{Exposure Times:} Our exposure times are set by detecting the H$_2$ and ionized gas diagnostic lines.  For the arm, we aim to detect the H$_2$ 0-0 S(2) 12.28 \micron\ line at 3.1$\times$10$^{-6}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/sr, the surface brightness measured from {\em Spitzer}/SINGS. With 4 exposures and 80 groups each (888s exposure) we will obtain S/N$\sim$3.  The [Ne{\small II}] and [Ne{\small III}] lines will be detected with very high S/N. The PAH continuum will have low S/N at R$\sim$3000 but will be spectrally binned to recover higher S/N since the features are broad.   For the nucleus, we target the high ionization neon and sulfur lines ([Ne{\small VI}]7.65\micron, [Ne{\small V}]14.33\micron, [S{\small IV}]10.52\micron).  The strengths of these lines vary strongly; as a benchmark we aim to detect lines 10x fainter than [Ne{\small III}]15.56\micron\ as observed with {\em Spitzer}, $1.0{\times}10^{-5}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/sr. With 4 exposures and 40 groups (444s), we will achieve S/N$>$3.  For the simultaneous imaging in F2550W, we use multiple integrations with 20 groups to avoid saturation.

We request the same PA for all NIRCam mosaics to match coverage in the line and continuum filters.  We require PA constraints for the IFU mosaics to cover the AGN and jet and cut perpendicular to a spiral arm.  We sequence the MIRI IFU observations within 10 hours to ensure that the ``offs''  bracket the target observation. We group the MIRI mosaic and ``off'' within 10 hours to minimize time variations of the background.

We propose parallel observations with NIRISS in wideband filters 
%(F090W, F150W, F200W, F277W) 
(F090W, F150W, F200W) 
to study M51's stellar halo. The parallels will fall outside the main disk of M51, although with PA$\sim$140$\deg$ the NIRISS parallel can cover M51b. The parallels address distinct science goals from the primary observations, but provide the community representative data for parallels around nearby galaxies. The imaging will reach $\sim$1--2 magnitudes below the tRGB, separating stars from background galaxies with JWST's high resolution. We will measure the age of the stellar populations as a function of radius and search for low surface brightness substructure using star counts. Substructures provide strong constraints on the accretion histories of galaxies \citep{bullock2005,pillepich2014} and of the dark matter subhalos that surround them \citep{johnston1999}.
